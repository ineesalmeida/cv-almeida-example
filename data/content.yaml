Profile: When I’m not working, I write Python scripts and design websites for fun. When I’m working, I try to do the same. I see myself as a versatile hard-worker that is passionate about learning new skills and to be useful in the work environment.
# Just in the past year, I have designed 4 websites, written a neuroscience paper, developed a couple of apps with python frameworks and built a small video game from scratch.
