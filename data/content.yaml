Profile: When I’m not working, I write Python scripts and design websites for fun. When I’m working, I try to do the same. I am always up for a challenge. In the past year, I have designed websites, written a neuroscience paper, developed apps with python and built a computer game from scratch. I am a very focused person whose laptop is full of post-its to keep my tasks organized.
