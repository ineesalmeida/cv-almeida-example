Profile: I am a Biomedical Engineer by degree and a Developer by affinity. I see myself as a versatile hard worker that enjoys being useful in the work environment. I actively try to solve problems and I take responsibility for the work I do. As a Software Engineer, my experience in Test Engineering and data processing made me a better developer. I'm particularly interested in this position for its chance to merge both my interest in Software Development and Biomedical data.
